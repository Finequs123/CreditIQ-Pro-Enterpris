The structure / function  of the system is as follows: -	User Module with Role definition and menu access rights
-	Scorecard Setup
o	Will be able to set up a new AI-generated scorecard based on certain questions (this module is already available as part of CreditIQProPlus Personalitsation Setup.  Once the user defines the requirement using this frontend, the AI will automatically generate the score card, which gets stored as default score card (need to have proper naming convention , version, product name, and date time for easy identification)
-	Score Card Modification
o	Manual changes / adjustments.  This option is exactly same as the “Dynamic configuration” (this module is already available as part of LoanScoreValidator).  We need to add a functionality for the user to select the score card which he / she wants to modify.  Upon updation and save, system will create a new score card (naming convention to be followed). Also, we need to create an additional tab for Score Card, where it will display all the scorecard currently maintained in the system with option for the user to deactivate or activate.  If deactivated, this score card will not appear in any drop down across the system.  
	Note: as part of the naming convention, we need to Start with AI or MA, depending on who has built the score card viz. auto generated by AI or manual generated 
o	AI Driven:  when the user does a bulk upload of data or connect to a database through API, and select the score card to be applied, system will process the file and provide the outcome.  During such time, it will also recommend a new scorecard (if required) to make the outcome even more effective.  User can choose to test the same data with AI recommended score card and should be able to match the results and decide whether to go with the original score card or the AI version.  (currently this automated AI recommended score card is available as part of bulk upload option in CreditIQProPlus) 
o	Let’s have ‘maker-checker’ option for any scorecard to become effective or made available as part of the drop down across various menu 
-	Score Card Effectivess Report : We need to add charts or tables to show effectiveness of each score card (upon selection) based on data processed in the past (provide timeline or by file)
-	Retain A/B testing option which is already there in CreditIQProPlus
-	Retain Scoring Guide module which is already there in CreditIQProPlus
-	Retain API Module which is also there in CreditIQProPlus
-	Retain History & Audit Trail, which is also there in CreditIQProPlus
-	Bulk Upload, Individual Scoring  to be retained as it is available in CreditIQProPlus (however, let’s add more charts or table to show the outcome of the file / data processed). Retain all other functionalities within this module as it is.  --- how do we go about doing this.  Do we enhance the existing CreditIQProPlus by adding the new functionalities / transfer of functionalities from LendingScoreValidator or built from scratch.  We will be using Replit and both the current systems that we referred here as in Replit.
